Stethoscope
===========

This project aims to create a research-validated stethoscope whose plans are available freely and openly. The goal is for the bell to cost ~USD$1-2 to produce, and the rest of the stethoscope to cost approximately the same.

Currently, the stethoscope resulting from this project functions as well as the market gold standard, the Littmann Cardiology III.


Bill of Materials
=================

See Bill_of_materials.md

**Printed parts:**
* 1 stethoscope head (head.stl)
* 2 ear tubes (eartube.stl)
* 1 earplug mold (earplug_mold.stl)

**Other hardware:**
* 40cm Silicone 12mm OD, 8mm ID
* 20cm UPVC 6mm OD, 4mm ID
* Silicone for ear plugs
* Diaphragm: Cut from a report cover with approx 0.35mm plastic sheet, we used a Staples 21639 (UPC 718103160223)
* Silicone / Rubber ring for diaphram mount



Print Instructions
==================
All printed parts should be printed with PLA plastic at 0.2mm layer height, though it is acceptable for the first layer to be 0.3mm. Infill should be 100%.


Assembly Instructions
=====================
* Insert silicone into mold and allow to set as per manufacturer instructions.
* Attach the diaphragm to the stethoscope head.
* Attach the stethoscope head to the silicone tube.
* Attach the silicone tube to the T-Piece.
* Attach the T-piece to the ear tubes.
* Attach the ear tubes to the molded earplugs.
* Test the stethoscope as per the validation instructions.


Other stethoscopes
